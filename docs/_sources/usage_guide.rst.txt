Description
===========

This guide provides detailed instructions and examples for using the functions 
provided in the ``eda_toolkit`` library and how to use them effectively in your projects.

For the ensuing examples, we will leverage the Census Income Data (1994) from
the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset provides a rich source of
information for demonstrating the functionalities of the ``eda_toolkit``. You can
find more details and download the dataset from the `UCI Machine Learning Repository <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income>`_.


Path Directories
=================

.. function:: ensure_directory(path)

    Ensure that the directory exists. If not, create it.

    :param path: The path to the directory that needs to be ensured.
    :type path: str

    :returns: None


The ``ensure_directory`` function is a utility designed to facilitate the 
management of directory paths within your project. When working with data 
science projects, it is common to save and load data, images, and other 
artifacts from specific directories. This function helps in making sure that 
these directories exist before any read/write operations are performed. If 
the specified directory does not exist, the function creates it. If it 
already exists, it does nothing, thus preventing any errors related to 
missing directories.


**Example Usage**

In the example below, we demonstrate how to use the ``ensure_directory`` function 
to verify and create directories as needed. This example sets up paths for data and 
image directories, ensuring they exist before performing any operations that depend on them.

First, we define the base path as the parent directory of the current directory. 
The ``os.pardir`` constant, equivalent to ``..``, is used to navigate up one 
directory level. Then, we define paths for the data directory and data output 
directory, both located one level up from the current directory. Next, we set 
paths for the PNG and SVG image directories, located within an ``images`` folder 
in the parent directory. Using the `ensure_directory` function, we then verify 
that these directories exist. If any of the specified directories do not exist, 
the function creates them.

.. code-block:: python


    import eda_toolkit # import main library
    import os # import operating system for dir

.. code-block:: python

    base_path = os.path.join(os.pardir)

    # Go up one level from 'notebooks' to the parent directory, 
    # then into the 'data' folder
    data_path = os.path.join(os.pardir, "data")
    data_output = os.path.join(os.pardir, "data_output")

    # create image paths
    image_path_png = os.path.join(base_path, "images", "png_images")
    image_path_svg = os.path.join(base_path, "images", "svg_images")

    # Use the function to ensure the 'data' directory exists
    eda_toolkit.ensure_directory(data_path)
    eda_toolkit.ensure_directory(data_output)
    eda_toolkit.ensure_directory(image_path_png)
    eda_toolkit.ensure_directory(image_path_svg)

**Output**

.. code-block:: python

    Created directory: ../data
    Created directory: ../data_output
    Created directory: ../images/png_images
    Created directory: ../images/svg_images
